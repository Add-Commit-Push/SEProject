### Getting up and running

1. Run `npm install` from the root directory
2. Run `gulp dev` (may require installing Gulp globally `npm install gulp -g`)
3. Your browser will automatically be opened and directed to the browser-sync proxy address
4. To prepare assets for production, run the `npm run build` task (Note: the production task does not fire up the browser-sync server, and won't provide you with browser-sync's live reloading. Simply use `gulp dev` during development. More information below)
