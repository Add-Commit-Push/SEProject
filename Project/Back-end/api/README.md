# API

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Setting up:

Starting the server running locally:

- Clone
- `npm install`
- Run MongoDB on the default `port:27017` ([instructions on setting up mongo](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/#tutorials))
- `npm run dev` to start the local server
- you are now ready to make calls to the API at `http://localhost:3000/api`

# Code Overview

## Application Structure

- `app.js` - The entry point to our application. This file defines our express server and connects it to MongoDB using mongoose. It also requires the routes and models we'll be using in the application.
- `config/` - This folder contains configuration for passport as well as a central location for configuration/environment variables.
- `routes/` - This folder contains the route definitions for our API.
- `models/` - This folder contains the schema definitions for our Mongoose models.

## Error Handling

In `routes/api/index.js`, we define a error-handling middleware for handling Mongoose's `ValidationError`. This middleware will respond with a 422 status code and format the response to have error messages the clients can understand

## Authentication

Requests are authenticated using the `Authorization` header with a valid JWT. We define two express middlewares in `routes/auth.js` that can be used to authenticate requests. The `required` middleware configures the `express-jwt` middleware using our application's secret and will return a 401 status code if the request cannot be authenticated. The payload of the JWT can then be accessed from `req.payload` in the endpoint. The `optional` middleware configures the `express-jwt` in the same way as `required`, but will _not_ return a 401 status code if the request cannot be authenticated.
